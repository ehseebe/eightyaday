> The funnest little characters Iâ€™ve ever done. Terramor farms in Renfrew, Ontario is an awesome farm with great growing ethics and some even better produce. For their merch, they wanted their existing logo turned into a little character and this buddy with the rubber boots on is what I came up with. Being from the Ottawa Valley myself I knew the imagery of the hay, and this little friend poking out from behind it really gave it that valley feel. I also love the little tomato and carrot character too.
