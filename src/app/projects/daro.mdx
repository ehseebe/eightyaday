> Probably my biggest mural to date at 18 feet tall. Painted for Daro in Little Burgundy, this project was really fun to work on. Daro is a data company named after the ancient city of Daro that had the first sewer system in existence. Daro wanted my personal style to be reflected in a mural that combined the sewer idea with tech/data, so naturally I needed both a rat and a gator (both well-known sewer dwellers) included in the design. The fill colour in the design is spray paint, and all of the outlines are done with 1 shot enamel paint and a brush.
