> I entered The 2024 Pabst Blue Ribbon Art Can Contest and I really love my submission. My design is inspired by Rube Goldberg machines and I appreciated the unique challenge of working in Pabst colours (red, white and blue) and beer can silver. Pabst may not have thought it was a winner but I know the best one.
