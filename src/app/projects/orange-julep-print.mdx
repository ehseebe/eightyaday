> Maybe the most iconic Montreal casse-croute, and a mega landmark of the city: Gibeau’s Orange Julep. It’s one of my favourite spots to go for a date night supper in the city and get a hotdog and hang out in the busy parking lot on the side of the decarie and people watch. I designed this print to be a risograph, but it had a lot of colours so I ended up giclée printing it on really nice heavy textured paper from Québec City. That’s my old truck I drew in there as an easter egg.
