> Jean + Dean is a bakery in Kingston, Ontario with the most decadent treats, tarts and donuts. I designed their logo illustrations with a rolling pin and bakingâ€™s superstar ingredient ~ butter. I illustrated and designed a poster for their Christmas, pop-up collaboration with The Lake in Kingston that included a cute butter tart building. YUM!
