> Like any true Montrealer, I love the depanneur. Everything about it— for beers, muffins,or chips, and for a petit-friendly conversation with dep people. I made this really nice giclée print, an ode to its place of print in Quebec City. I even created this little video commercial for this design when the prints went up for sale in 2020, and included a little song I wrote.
