> One October afternoon in 2023 I painted a quick fun mural at The Swan Dive bar in Toronto. The Swan Dive is mystic, and spooky and fun so at the top of their stairs I painted this mystically coloured raccoon looking into a crystal ball that has a shot of tequila with a two headed worm in it. It looks cool and was fun to paint.
