> If you’ve ever been to this place, or driven by it on your family vacation to Florida you totally get this without explanation. Ink and watercolour on heavy paper drawn in the bed of my truck in the parking lot of S.O.B before buying 70,000 firecrackers and a hat shaped like a hotdog. I made these into some bigger sized giclée prints in Quebec City, Quebec.
