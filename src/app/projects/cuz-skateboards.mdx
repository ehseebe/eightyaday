> At the beginning of the pandemic (the era of massive toilet paper hoarding) I teamed up with Canadian skateboard company CUZ with this end-of-days themed “Industrial Society and Its Future” t-shirt graphic. After it dropped, I wore mine to every vaccination appointment and Covid-19 travel test I had, and every time got some pretty good looks from people working there.
