# Bike Polo

Over the years I have done a gazillion bajillion million bike polo related drawings and projects and t-shirts and posters. I don’t know how many of them have been lost to time, but here’s a couple of the highlights. One is a mallet head by FIXCRAFT for the legendary NYC/OTTAWA/RVA polo team The Means. There’s a Bike Polo Toronto t-shirt design, a t-shirt design for an Ottawa tournament, and a self portrait of me playing bike polo.
