> I have been lucky to work with Montreal’s urban agriculture company Lufa Farms on multiple occasions. I painted murals in two greenhouses, compost bins, murals in their office in Ahuntsic, t-shirts, pocket designs for t-shirts and my favourite two Mother’s day cards on wildflower seed paper that can be planted to grow cute lil’ flowers. I love drawing fruits and vegetables, especially as personified characters so these designs were very fun to do. The Lufavore t-shirts were actually the employee t-shirts for a while so if you ever had the chance of visiting one of the sites you probably saw employees picking cucumbers and micro greens wearing this design looking cool even when it’s hot.
