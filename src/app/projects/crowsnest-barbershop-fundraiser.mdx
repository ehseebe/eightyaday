> In 2019, Crowsnest Barbershop in Ottawa held a fundraiser where they asked artists to re-imagine some Lucky Cats. I took mine in a different direction and shaped it loosely into my iconic raccoon character. I sanded, primed and painted my ‘lucky cat’ grey with the raccoon eye mask and a red collar. I also designed a 3-D printed raccoon tail which I epoxied onto the back of the cat and then used an x-tra tuff garbage bag glued to the front to look like the raccoon was digging in the garbage. This design obviously fundraised some big bucks.
