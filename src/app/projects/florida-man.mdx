> A “pro-model” skateboard I built with Fred Bouin at his woodshed. Canadian maple wood plies moulded and glued, cut, sanded, and drilled in Montreal. The skateboard was made as a gift for legendary Florida punk skateboarder Joe Dunn III. The design is Florida’s own Bigfoot, the skunk ape. I painted the design using a mixture of acrylic and 1 shot enamel paints. After painting, the board was glazed over the paint to make it shiny but also to offer it a bit of protection if it was ever actually used to boardslide a 200 stair handrail.
