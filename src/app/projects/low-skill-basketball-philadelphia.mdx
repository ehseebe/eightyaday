> When Philadelphia-based basketball league Low-Skill Basketball Philly reached out to me to create their logo for some t-shirts for their basketball league I could imagine the design right away. The low-skill name influenced the ball character hitting the rim, and I wanted the classic ball balancing on the finger to illustrate as well. I used my finger as a reference for this one, and it wasn’t easy! It was hard to get the ball to balance for more than 0.01 seconds to get the photo, so my camera roll was full of failed attempts. This was a really fun project and even boosted my athleticism at the end of the day. I used the 76’ers colours, because Philly.
