> In 2023 I had the opportunity to work with Montreal author Alyssa Beaton Tanguay doing the cover and some illustrations for the second edition of her urban plant guide, Sidewalk Plants. I love urban nature, so doing these illustrations were fun and I love the guide itself. While there arenâ€™t many illustrations of actual plants, illustrating the methods of uses of medicinal and herbal plants (tinctures, compresses, tea, etc.) was wicked cute and fun.
