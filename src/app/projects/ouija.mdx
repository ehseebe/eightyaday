> When I had the idea to make ouija boards I really underestimated how much work it was gonna take. From start to finish they took me like a year but thanks to a ton of help from my friend Fred Bouin I got there. These are made with super nice Russian Birch sourced in Montreal. First, I drew the design and converted it into a 3-D CAD file. Next, the boards were cut to size, sanded to a smooth finish, stained with high-quality black stain, and then cut with the design. To top it off, they received a nice polish with a few coats of wax. The planchette was the same, but after they were done the back of them was fixed with a little piece of plastic for maximum slide-ability when youâ€™re communicating with the other realms.
