> Florida is near and dear to my heart. A very interesting, naturally beautiful and problematic enigma of a place. This print is my love letter to Florida. Kind words, a gator, orange blossoms and the juice train. Watercolour and waterproof ink on the original, heavy-duty giclée from Québec, Québec for the prints.
