> Futur proche (translation: near future) was my first Japanese riso print which I set up myself and printed in Montrealâ€™s parc extension neighbourhood with NoGloss Riso. The set up for the riso was a wild learning curve. I created these colours up by transitioning primary colours to different opacities. I really like this print.
