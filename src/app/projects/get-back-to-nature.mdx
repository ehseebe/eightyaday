> These t-shirts were originally designed as a fundraiser for a Montreal youth-run garbage clean-up initiative in the city in the first run. I love bugs and animals, especially all the urban animals you see on a walk around the city, itâ€™s like a safari without leaving home. I got a bunch of photos of all the cool ways people have modified these shirts including tie-dying and cropping them. I cut the sleeves off of mine and I wore it for a week on a long bike camping trip. The print held up and it looks as good as the day I got it from the shop.
