> I always love the opportunity to draw portraits of people's pets, it’s fun and special and people are really happy when they get them. They’re like dogs 99% of the time, and sometimes they’re pretty customized which is cool. It’s a shame that nobody’s asked me to do a portrait of their pet tarantula or Komodo dragon yet.
