> A really close-to-my-heart project. I worked with Boston Terrier Rescue Canada for a fundraiser to support the cost of vet bills for Boston Terrier rescues. The featured illustration is of a Boston Terrier and what’s on their mind 24/7, complete with their scientific name and order “Canis Lupus Bostonious Terrierasaurus.” These designs are featured on merchandise that is sold to support fundraising efforts.
