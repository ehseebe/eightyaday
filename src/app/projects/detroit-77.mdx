> I did a set of illustrations for a Detroit-style deep-dish pizza pop-up in Almonte, Ontario. These designs are a central feature of the brand, with one of the illustrations used as the pop-up logo, one as a sticker, and the last as a 3-colour stamp featured on each pizza box. I wanted something that emphasized the uniqueness of the Detroit-style pizza, mixed with the motor-city edge of the Germanic style font.
