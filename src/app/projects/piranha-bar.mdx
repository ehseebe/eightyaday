> In 2022 - 2024 I had some fun doing some pretty-much-whatever-I-wanted-as-long-as-it-was-punk-metal-themed murals at Piranha Bar in Montreal. I started with the punk looking yellow and blue raccoon and the smoking clown in their green room. I went back another time to this sliding barn door and painted this tequila bottle FULL of worms (really funny). A third time they invited me to make a mural to be seen under black light so I painted this glowing raccoon and covered the walls and ceiling in neon pink worms. Most recently as part of a renovation they wanted something really metal looking in my style facing Ste. Catherines so I painted an evil raccoon in flames over a giant pile of skulls which also turned out pretty cool. These were fun.
