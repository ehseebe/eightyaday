> Ottawa Valley grown and foraged mushrooms by mycology expert Brodie Barrie. Forest Floor also sells logs that have been inoculated with mushroom spores so you can grow them yourself at home. With this in mind, and wanting to use an illustration of a mushroom that they actually grow so I went with the shiitake variety on a log for this logo. The logo turned out friendly, earthy, warm and mushroomy and Iâ€™m super proud of it. This is used in branding, t-shirts, stickers and stamps for the bags of mushrooms.
