> Originally based in Oakland, California but now based in Savannah, Georgia, Loco Metal Works is an artist whose medium is metal. Their work is incredible, from chain candle holders to spider web shelf brackets. I illustrated this logo for them that would work as a one-colour screen print that could be adaptable to hats or hoodies. I liked the shaded broken chain, but also thought it worked with the mysterious bad boy welder character, so we decided to go with both. I think they turned out great and I was happy to see one of the hats out in the wild on a trip to California this fall.
