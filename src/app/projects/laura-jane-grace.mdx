> Just for fun I created a reimagined Laura Jane Grace record sleeve for my favourite album of hers “stay alive”. I was learning to use illustrator at the time so it was my first real crack at creating my own lettering. Mixed with my skull illustration and the mock-worn-record sleeve I think it came out pretty cool.
