# Courrier Caverne

As an avid cyclist, I had a blast designing these illustrations for my local Villeray bike shop and caf√© Courrier Caverne. The set includes a super spooky grim reaper, a subtle self-portrait of me stunt man jumping over some flaming cars (the sad flat tire was on the same shirt as this design), an urban-stylized illustration of the shop with Courrier Caverne, and a road-cycling-style head tube badge sticker featuring iconic Montreal landmarks.
