# Club Quad

A fun little re-vamp of Club Quad Du Pontiac’s yearly trail pass in Quebec’s Pontiac section of the Outaouais region. I included multiple elements, capturing the extreme fun of ATV and trail-riding, while incorporating the natural aspects of the landscape, while nodding to the Canadian, Québecois and First Nations people of the region.
