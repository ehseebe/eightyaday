        Hey there! I’m an illustrator based in Montreal, and I’m all about
        creating colourful, fun art that tells a story. Not too long ago, I made
        the leap from my 9-to-5 to dive headfirst into illustration and design,
        and I haven’t looked back.
      </p>
      <p className="text-text">
        I love drawing everything from comics and animals to bugs and bringing
        my illustrations to life with graphic design. I've had the pleasure of
        working with some amazing clients like Lufa Farms, Detroit Rapper
        Dopehead, Jean + Deans Bakery, CKCU FM Ottawa, and more. Whether it’s a
        logo, a mural, or a limited-edition tote bag, I’m here to make it
        happen.
      </p>
      <p className="text-text">
        I’ve showcased my personal art at exhibitions like the Sketch at Saw
        Gallery, and solo exhibitions, like Super Happy Artworks by Eightyaday
        hosted at The Manx in Ottawa. My work has appeared in publications The
        Dionysian (published in NYC) and Sidewalk Plants (Montreal publication).
        When I’m not drawing, you can find me on long-haul bike adventures,
        hanging out with dogs, or practicing my French. Ilove working on
        commissions and bringing the vision and stories of others to life on the
        page (or screen). If you’re looking for unique artwork or design, let’s
        chat!
